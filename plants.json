  "about": "Chili peppers, belonging to the genus *Capsicum*, are warm-season plants that thrive in specific environmental conditions. For optimal growth, they require a temperature range of 15-30°C (59-86°F), with humidity levels between 40-70%. Chili pepper plants need full sun and well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Direct sunlight can raise temperatures above 30°C (86°F), potentially stressing and damaging young plants. The ideal nighttime temperature is 18-21°C (65-70°F) and the daytime temperature is 21-26°C (70-80°F).\n\nNumerical information regarding their care includes watering about 1 inch per week. It is best to keep your soil a little on the dry side to help produce hotter peppers. For germination, a soil temperature of 23-29°C (75-85°F) is ideal. The plants need good drainage and hate to be stood in water.\n",
